# Analog-Clock
Analog clock is a clock that shows the time by using a circular disc and three traditional hour, minute, and second hands. We are going to build this by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
#Prerequisite <br>
HTML <br>
CSS <br>
JAVASCRIPT <br>
#Approach <br>
HTML: It is a simple file having the basic structure of the webpage and ID for the clockâ€™s body and for the second, minute, and hour hands. <br>
CSS: The CSS is used just for making the clock actually look a bit nicer. We have basically centered our clock in the middle of the webpage.<br>
JavaScript: The JavaScript file will provide the logic behind the rotation of the hands.<br>
First, we have selected the hour, minute, and second from HTML.<br>
To get the current time we have used the Date() object provided by the JavaScript. This will give the current seconds, minutes, and hours respectively.<br>
Now, we have got our hour, minute, and second, and we know that the clock rotates 360 degrees. So, we will convert to  the rotation of the hands of the clock into degrees. The degree calculation is based on a simple unary method.
